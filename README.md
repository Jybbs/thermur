## 🐦‍⬛ The Biological Inspiration

I've spent countless hours watching starling murmurations since my childhood in Western Massachusetts. During winter breaks from school, I'd walk through snow-covered fields at dusk, when thousands of starlings would gather before roosting. I still have a vivid memory from when I was about nine, watching a hawk cut through the flock directly overhead. What struck me wasn't just the synchronized beauty of their flight, but how instantly they transformed when threatened. The smooth, flowing patterns shattered into chaotic motion, with sharp directional changes and an even tighter ink-like density that painted the sky black wherever they went. Most remarkably, I could instinctively track the hawk's position by watching these ripples of disorder move through the flock.

**The invisible predator became visible through the birds' collective response.**

### From Tragedy to Technology

On June 30, 2013, nineteen members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots were fatally overtaken by the Yarnell Hill Fire [^1]. The crew's lookout had lost visual contact, and by the time the fire's convective plume reappeared, its lethal speed and direction left no time for escape. That incident, my own visit to the entrapment site, and the ever-increasing incidence of destructive wildfires have profoundly shaped my perspective. They underscore an ethical obligation to orient my work in machine learning directly toward preventing this kind of tragedy.

What's fundamentally challenging about firefighter entrapments like these [^2] is that the most critical information on a fireground—the instantaneous, localized flow of heat and air—is dangerously invisible. Anemometers provide numbers, but the human brain is wired for something far more primitive and powerful: the perception of coherent motion [^3]. Classic studies have shown that we can recognize complex activity from just a few moving points of light, a phenomenon known as "biological motion" perception [^4].

### The Biomimetic Insight

What if wildfire could be recast as the "predator" in this biological system? Could we create a flock of robots that responds to thermal threats the way starlings react to a predator? Could we model their movement, measure their cohesion, and coordinate their alignment within the context of their flock [^5]? And most critically, could this system translate an invisible threat into a visual language that firefighters could intuitively understand?

**Thermur** (a portmanteau of "thermal" and "murmuration") was born from this biomimetic insight. With modern micro-robotics now capable of surviving brief excursions up to 475K [^6], we can finally implement a system where:

> *A flock of robots, governed by the mathematical rules of a starling flock responding to a predator [^7], learns to move in such a way that it not only survives the thermal chaos of a wildfire but also translates that chaos into a dynamic visual display that is immediately legible to a human under pressure.*

### Core Scientific Contributions

1. **Heterogeneous Behavioral Variance**: Individual noise amplitudes drawn from $`\eta_i \sim N(\mu=0.7, \sigma=0.20)`$ create the behavioral heterogeneity necessary for critical state dynamics. Based on the framework from [^8] with an optimized mean value, this continuous spectrum of responses, ranging from strongly aligning agents with low $`\eta_i`$ to weakly aligning agents with high $`\eta_i`$, maintains elevated susceptibility $`\chi \sim N`$ [^9] and enables the scale-free correlations observed in natural murmurations [^10].

2. **Topological Interactions**: Each agent responds to exactly $`k=7`$ nearest neighbors regardless of distance, matching empirical observations of starling behavior [^11] and enabling scale-free information transfer with propagation speeds of 15-45 m/s [^12].

3. **Thermal Safety Constraints**: Smooth penalty-based safety using the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser formulation [^13], ensuring agents avoid thermal limits ($`T < 475K`$) through gradient-based corrections that integrate seamlessly with neural network training.

4. **Graph Neural Networks**: Permutation-equivariant architecture [^14] that naturally handles dynamic flock topologies through message-passing on k-nearest neighbor graphs, implemented with PyTorch Geometric [^15].

## 📐 Mathematical Framework

The system bridges biological observation with robotic control through a unified theorem that maintains critical state dynamics while guaranteeing thermal safety. For complete derivations, see [`docs/mathematical-framework.md`](docs/mathematical-framework.md).

### Unified Murmuration Control Theorem

Natural starling flocks achieve near-instantaneous information propagation through a delicate phase transition between order and disorder. We engineer this criticality through heterogeneous behavioral variance, where individual noise amplitudes $`\eta_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma=0.20)`$ create a continuous spectrum of responses [^8]. This heterogeneity, wherein some agents strongly align while others move more independently, generates the variance necessary for scale-free correlations.

Given $`N`$ agents with positions $`\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3`$ and velocities $`\mathbf{v}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3`$, the control law:

$`
\hspace{0.5cm} \displaystyle
\mathbf{u}_i^* = \mathbf{u}_i^{\text{nom}} - \kappa \cdot \nabla T \cdot \sigma(-\rho c)
`$  
<br>

where the nominal control orchestrates multiple biologically-inspired components:

$`
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u}_i^{\text{nom}} = &\underbrace{\frac{8\lambda}{v_0^6}(v_0^2 - |\mathbf{v}_i|^2)^3\hat{\mathbf{v}}_i + \eta_i \boldsymbol{\xi}_i}_{\text{Quartic speed confinement}} + \underbrace{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_k(i)} J_{ij} (\mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_i)}_{\text{Maximum entropy alignment}} \\
&- \underbrace{\gamma_{\text{sep}} \sum_{r_{ij} < r_{\text{min}}} \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ji}}{r_{ij}^3}}_{\text{Separation}} - \underbrace{\beta\nabla T + D\nabla\rho(1+2\theta_i)}_{\text{Environmental response}}
\end{aligned}
`$  

The quartic speed confinement term [^16] and maximum entropy alignment [^17] work together to maintain critical dynamics.
<br>

### The Mechanism of Criticality

In bird flocks, individuals exhibit varying degrees of alignment with their neighbors, creating a natural heterogeneity in the system. We model this through individual noise amplitudes drawn from a Gaussian distribution $`\eta_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma=0.20)`$, which enables continuous phase transitions [^8].

Agents with low noise amplitudes strongly align with their neighbors, while those with high amplitudes move more independently. This continuous spectrum of behaviors rather than discrete states creates the variance necessary for critical dynamics. The resulting susceptibility $`\chi`$ scales with flock size $`N`$, confirming the system remains at criticality without requiring explicit anti-alignment mechanisms.

Each agent watches exactly 7 nearest neighbors regardless of distance [^11]. This "topological" rule means information spreads the same way whether the flock is spread out or compressed, enabling rapid response across the entire group.

### Speed Regulation Through Marginal Confinement

Natural flocks maintain remarkably stable cruising speeds despite constant interactions and perturbations. This stability emerges from marginal speed confinement [^16], a mechanism where birds experience minimal resistance near their preferred velocity but increasingly strong restoring forces as they deviate further from it. The quartic potential structure, rather than the simpler quadratic forms often used in robotics, resolves a fundamental tension in collective behavior. It permits the speed fluctuations necessary for information propagation while preventing the flock from either dispersing into chaos or grinding to a halt.

Our implementation uses this biologically-validated mechanism instead of artificial damping, ensuring agents achieve their full cruising speed of 11.1 m/s rather than being artificially capped at lower velocities.

### Aerodynamic Realism

Starlings don't fly through still air. They navigate wind fields that constantly push and pull them, demanding continuous adjustment of their flight forces. Our physics incorporates realistic aerodynamic drag calibrated from wind tunnel measurements of European starlings [^18], wherein drag depends on motion through the air mass itself rather than motion relative to the ground.

This distinction matters profoundly. A bird flying at 11 m/s into a 5 m/s headwind experiences the same aerodynamic forces as one flying at 16 m/s in calm air. Our agents exploit tailwinds to conserve energy, work harder against headwinds to maintain speed, and allow crosswinds to naturally drift them sideways. 

These dynamics emerge naturally from the physics rather than being explicitly programmed. The calibration from empirical bird flight data ensures that when our flock encounters the complex wind fields around wildfire plumes from WRF-Fire simulations, their responses match what we would observe in real starlings navigating similar conditions.

### Density Waves and Thermal Response

When starlings detect a hawk, waves of movement ripple through the flock at speeds of 15-45 m/s [^12], much faster than any individual bird flies. These waves create dark bands that look like ink spreading through water. We reproduce this effect using reaction-diffusion equations, where crowding in one area causes neighboring regions to spread out, creating visible waves.

When the flock encounters high temperatures, these density waves combine with temperature gradient following. The result is a flock that flows away from heat while the density waves make the danger visible through the pattern of movement.

### Safety Guarantees

The thermal safety system uses smooth Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser penalties to guide agents away from dangerous temperatures [^13]. The gradient-based corrections create a continuous force field that intensifies near thermal boundaries, ensuring agents naturally avoid excessive heat without requiring optimization solvers.

This guarantees agents never exceed 475 K, the maximum safe temperature for the hardware. Unlike rule-based systems that might fail in unexpected situations, this mathematical approach ensures safety in all conditions.

### Emergent Properties

The unified control law produces emergent dynamics that match biological flocks without explicit programming. These properties arise naturally from the interplay between heterogeneous coupling, topological interactions, and active matter dynamics [^19]:

- **Critical State**: Maintained through heterogeneous noise $`\eta_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma=0.20)`$ creating behavioral variance
- **Rapid Response**: Information propagates at 15-45 m/s through topological networks
- **Scale-Free Dynamics**: Velocity correlations follow $`C(r) \sim r^{-1/3}`$ across all flock sizes
- **Robust Cohesion**: Topological interactions with k=7 neighbors ensure connectivity
- **Thermal Safety**: Smooth penalties maintain $`T < 475`$ K through gradient corrections

These emergent behaviors are verified through the comprehensive metrics suite described in [Monitoring & Metrics](#5-monitoring--metrics), ensuring the trained policy preserves the expert controller's critical dynamics.

For details on the WRF-SFIRE dataset and data procurement, see [`docs/data-procurement.md`](docs/data-procurement.md).

### Training Workflow

The imitation learning pipeline leverages [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) for training orchestration and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) for graph-based learning:

#### 1. Expert Trajectory Generation

The physics-based controller generates optimal trajectories using [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/)-validated configuration:

```python
from thermur.imitation.controller import MurmurationController, ThermalPenalty
from config.imitation.controller  import MurmurationModel, SafetyModel

# Create thermal safety filter
safety  = SafetyModel(
    ks_kappa         = 100.0,  # Penalty weight
    ks_rho           = 30.0,   # Sharpness parameter
    max_temperature  = 475.0,  # Critical threshold [K]
    thermal_alpha    = 2.5     # Convergence rate
)
penalty = ThermalPenalty(safety)

# Expert maintains critical state through heterogeneous noise
expert = MurmurationController(
    mmm     = MurmurationModel(
        agent_count         = 30,    # Number of agents in flock
        heterogeneity_mean  = 0.7,   # Mean noise amplitude μ
        heterogeneity_std   = 0.20,  # Noise heterogeneity σ
        j_base              = 1.3,   # Uniform coupling strength J₀
        k_neighbors         = 7,     # Topological interaction
    ),
    penalty = penalty,
    safety  = safety
)
```

#### 2. Behavioral Cloning with GNN

The [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) GNN learns from expert demonstrations:

```python
from thermur.imitation.training.policy import GNNPolicy
from torch_geometric.nn                import GCNConv

class GNNPolicy(LightningModule):
    def __init__(
        self,
        architecture : ArchitectureModel,
        metrics      : MetricsFactory,
        optimizer    : Callable[..., Optimizer],
        scheduler    : Callable[..., LRScheduler]
    ):
        super().__init__()
        # Build GNN layers with PyTorch Geometric
        dim, n = architecture.hidden_dim, architecture.num_layers
        layers = lambda m: ModuleList([m(dim, dim) for _ in range(n)])

        self.activation = getattr(nn, architecture.activation)()
        self.convs      = layers(GCNConv)
        self.decoder    = Linear(dim, 3)     # 3D actions
        self.encoder    = Linear(13, dim)    # Node features
        self.grus       = layers(GRUCell)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # Behavioral cloning loss
        actions_pred = self(batch)
        loss = mse_loss(actions_pred, batch.action)
        self.log("train/loss", loss)
        return loss
```

#### 3. Dataset Generation

Using [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) for efficient graph-based learning from offline trajectories:

```python
from torch_geometric.data           import Data, InMemoryDataset
from torch_geometric.data.lightning import LightningDataset

class ExpertDataset(InMemoryDataset):
    ...

    def process(self):
        # Generate expert trajectories using stratified sampling across snapshots
        self.generator.wrf.load_datasets(self.raw_paths)

        trajectory_frames  = int(
            self.trajectory_duration / self.generator.physics.timeframe
        )
        n_snapshots        = self.generator.wrf.n_snapshots
        total_trajectories = n_snapshots * self.trajectories_per_snapshot

        data_list = []
        for snapshot_idx in range(n_snapshots):
            for _ in range(self.trajectories_per_snapshot):
                # Each trajectory uses consistent environmental conditions
                trajectory = self.murmuration.generate_trajectory(
                    generator    = self.generator,
                    num_frames   = trajectory_frames,
                    snapshot_idx = snapshot_idx
                )
                # Each trajectory is list of Data(x=[N,13], action=[N,3], edge_index=[2,E])
                data_list.extend(trajectory)

        self.save(self.collate(data_list), self.processed_paths[0])

    @classmethod
    def as_lightning_datamodule(
        cls,
        batch_size  : int,
        controller  : DictConfig,
        environment : DictConfig,
        generator   : TrajectoryGenerator,
        hardware    : HardwareModel,
        murmuration : MurmurationController,
        train_split : float,
        ui          : ThermurUI
    ) -> LightningDataset:
        # Create dataset with all necessary components for generation
        dataset = cls(
            controller                = controller,
            environment               = environment,
            generator                 = generator,
            murmuration               = murmuration,
            sample_url                = environment.dataset.sample_url,
            trajectories_per_snapshot = environment.dataset.trajectories_per_snapshot,
            trajectory_duration       = environment.dataset.trajectory_duration,
            ui                        = ui
        )

        # Random train/val split with PyG's index_select
        train_size = int(len(dataset) * train_split)
        indices    = torch.randperm(len(dataset))

        return LightningDataset(
            batch_size    = batch_size,
            num_workers   = hardware.num_workers,
            pin_memory    = hardware.pin_memory,
            train_dataset = dataset.index_select(indices[:train_size]),
            val_dataset   = dataset.index_select(indices[train_size:])
        )
```

#### 4. Safety Validation with Thermal Penalties

Every control command passes through the [QPTh](https://github.com/locuslab/qpth)-based safety filter:

```python
# Thermal constraint: c(x,u) = ∇T·u + α(T_max - T) ≥ 0
# Solved as QP: min ||u - u_nom||² s.t. ḣ(x,u) ≥ -α·h(x)
u_safe = cbf_filter.filter(flock_state, u_nominal)
```

#### 5. Monitoring & Metrics

The comprehensive metrics suite evaluates both imitation learning performance and preservation of emergent flocking behaviors:

**Imitation Learning Metrics:**

- **Acceleration**: Tracks average control effort to ensure physically plausible forces

- **MAE/RMSE/R²**: Measure how accurately the policy reproduces expert actions, with MAE < 1.0 m/s² indicating excellent imitation

- **Velocity**: Monitors mean flight speed remains realistic (9-12 m/s for starlings [^22])

**Emergent Behavior Metrics:**

- **Correlation Length $`\xi/L`$**: Measures normalized spatial scale where velocity correlations decay to threshold. The ratio $`\xi/L \approx 0.35`$ indicates near-critical scale-free correlations characteristic of natural murmurations [^10].

- **Effective Energy $`E = -\sum J_{ij} \mathbf{s}_i \cdot \mathbf{s}_j`$**: Tracks the maximum entropy energy function with uniform coupling, where behavioral variance from heterogeneous noise drives phase transitions.

- **Fiedler Value $`\lambda_2`$**: Quantifies algebraic connectivity via the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, computed efficiently using adaptive Lanczos iteration. Positive values ensure flock cohesion.

- **Noise Heterogeneity**: Monitors variance in individual noise amplitudes to maintain critical dynamics

- **Susceptibility $`\chi`$**: Measures collective responsiveness via integrated velocity correlations $`\chi = (1/N) \sum_{i \neq j} \langle \delta \tilde{\phi}_i \cdot \delta \tilde{\phi}_j \rangle`$ within interaction radius. At criticality, $`\chi`$ scales with system size as $`\chi \sim N^{\gamma/3\nu}`$ [^12] [^10].

**Dynamic Response Metrics:**

- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures local neighborhood cohesion via ratio of closed triangles to possible triangles

- **Orientation Wave**: Detects density waves by measuring spatial gradients in heading angles (0.15-0.40 rad/m during murmurations)

- **Pairwise Coherence**: Quantifies local velocity alignment via mean pairwise dot products $`C = \langle \hat{v}_i \cdot \hat{v}_j \rangle_{i \neq j}`$, capturing coordination during maneuvers

- **Polarization**: Measures global directional order via $`\Phi = |\langle \hat{v}_i \rangle|`$ with natural murmurations exhibiting $`\Phi \approx 0.96 \pm 0.03`$ [^10]

- **Thermal Reactivity**: Quantifies collective threat response via velocity-temperature spatial correlation

**Safety Metrics:**

- **Temperature**: Average thermal exposure across the flock

- **Thermal Violations**: Minimized through smooth penalty corrections

## 🔧 Installation & Development

### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.14, installed by mise at the version `.mise/config.toml` pins
- **Storage**: 1.5GB for sample data, 6TB for full dataset
- **OS**: Linux on x86-64 or arm64, or macOS on Apple silicon or Intel, each a platform `.mise/mise.lock` records the pinned Python and uv for, or Windows through WSL2, since the tasks under `.mise/tasks/` run in bash

### Installation

*Thermur* pins Python and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), and `uv.lock` records the version every dependency resolves to on each platform, so a fresh clone installs those same versions on every platform System Requirements lists. The commands under Quick Start build that environment, after which one command reports any condition the clone still lacks, beside the command that supplies it:

```bash
mise doctor project
```

### Tasks

Each operation runs as a mise task, and the tasks that run the formatter and pytest run them at the versions `uv.lock` holds rather than any copy the machine already carries:

| **Task** | **What It Does** |
|---|---|
| `mise test` | Runs the test suite through pytest, passing any further arguments to it |
| `mise coverage` | Runs the suite under coverage and writes the HTML report under `.cache/coverage/html` |
| `mise check` | Reports every rewrite and lint finding [*Prose*](https://prose.fyi) makes over `.mise/tasks`, `src`, and `tests` |
| `mise format` | Rewrites the Python source to *Prose*'s style |
| `mise audit` | Holds the Python version, the uv release, and the license to one value across the files restating them, every `uv run` a task runs to `--exact --locked`, the programs under `.mise/bin/` to one script, the build requirements to exact pins, and the wheel's `packages` and scripts to modules it carries |
| `mise lockfile` | Verifies `uv.lock` and `.mise/mise.lock` against `pyproject.toml` and `.mise/config.toml`, and that the lock holds every pinned tool for the running platform |
| `mise relock` | Re-resolves both lockfiles after either manifest changes |
| `mise scan` | Holds every package `uv.lock` resolves to the published advisories through `uv audit` |

---
